# How to delete an appointment in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to delete an appointment in the Flutter Calendar.

The Flutter Event Calendar allows you to delete an appointment. Use the calendar datasource's 'notifyListener' to send actions to the calendar.

In this example, you can get the appointment from the tapped details by using the calendar's 'onTap' callback. You can remove an appointment from the calendar data source using these appointment details.
